# Enum
Enums are used to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Each variant can optionally have associated data.

# Struct
Structs are used to create custom data types. They can be regular structs, tuple structs, or unit structs.

# Pattern Matching
Pattern matching is used to match a value against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches.
The `match` keyword is used for pattern matching.

# Tips
- Enums can have variants with different types and amounts of associated data.
- Use `impl` to define methods on enums.
- Use pattern matching to handle different enum variants.
- The `Option` enum is a powerful tool for handling nullable values safely.
- Use the `match` expression to destructure enums and execute code based on their variants.
