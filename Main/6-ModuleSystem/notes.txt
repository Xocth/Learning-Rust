# Packages and Crates
Packages are a bundle of one or more crates. A crate is a binary or library. The `Cargo.toml` file defines a package.

# Defining Modules
Modules are used to organize code within a crate. They are defined using the `mod` keyword.

# Paths
Paths are used to refer to items such as functions, structs, and modules. They can be absolute or relative.

# Module Privacy Rules
Modules can be public or private. By default, everything in a module is private. Use the `pub` keyword to make items public.

# The Use Keyword
The `use` keyword is used to bring paths into scope, making it easier to refer to items.

# Nested Paths
Nested paths allow you to bring multiple items into scope with a single `use` statement.

# Glob operator
The glob operator (`*`) is used to bring all items from a module into scope.

# Modules in separate files
Modules can be split into separate files to keep the codebase organized. The `mod` keyword is used to declare the module, and the file name matches the module name.
