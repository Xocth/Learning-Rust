# Structs
Structs are used to create custom data types. They are defined using the `struct` keyword.

# Method
Methods are functions defined within the context of a struct, enum, or trait object. They are defined using the `impl` keyword.

# Associated function
Associated functions are functions that are associated with a struct, enum, or trait object but do not take `self` as a parameter. They are often used for constructors.

# Tuple Structs
Tuple structs are similar to regular structs, but their fields do not have names. They are useful for simple structures.

# Tips
- Use `..` syntax to copy remaining fields from another instance.
- Use field init shorthand when the variable name matches the field name.
- Use tuple structs for simple data grouping without field names.
