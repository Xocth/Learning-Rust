#Underscores can be used in numbers to make them more readable as they are ignored by the compiler examples:
let x = 127_000
let y = 10_i64

#Assign using as keyword:
let x = 10 as i64;

#explicit type conversion
    let x = 127_000 as i64; 
    let y = 10_i32; 

    let z = x / (y as i64); // this is a cast operation / brackets arent necessary but for clarity
    println!("z: {}", z); // explicit type conversion
