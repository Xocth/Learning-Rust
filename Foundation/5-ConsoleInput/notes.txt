#Prelude
the list of things that rust automatically imports into every rust program. It kept as small as possible and is focused on things,
particularly traits, which are used in almost every single rust program
allows us to use functions from the Rust Standard Library without manually importing

#Crate = Package or Library
these have a module, a piece of functionality like the IO module

#Syntax
use std::io; - this tells the compiler to use the std library to bring in the IO module
:: - path seperator operator, package to module, module to function/method
String::new() - creates an empty string to wait a new change
.expect - is used to handle any errors that may occur
