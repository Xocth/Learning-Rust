#Rust Tool Cargo in Terminal

cargo - checks if cargo is installed/working if currently in use
cargo new <filename> - creates a project package with src directory containing main.rs
cargo - (in cargo project) compiles and runs project just like rustc 
cargo build - compiles all of the code, set up dependencies
cargo run - compile and automatically run the code
cargo check - checks project, checks code without compiling

rustfmt <filename> - automatically formats code

#Files/folder
.lock - keeps track of all of the versions of the dependencies
target (folder) - contains the executable file
src (folder) - entry point
